customNavigationSites-help-text-paragraph1-x=For proper use of the "Custom Navigation Sites" Plugin, enter all site ids that should have their navigation included in this site's top level navigation (one site-id per line), followed by either a comma, then either <i>public</i> or <i>private</i> (no spaces!) - e.g. <i>{0},public</i> is a valid line. 
customNavigationSites-help-text-paragraph2-x=If you include the current site's id ({0}) in the list - with the public or private flag - its pages will be shown at the position you choose. You should include the current site's id in this list, otherwise navigation will be unintuitive for the user.
